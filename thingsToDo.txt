models
  1)
  Add validation to images for only certain types
  can do this by using the 'validation' key and passing an object with a key of 
    any name pointing to a function that takes in the rows value as input.

    validation: {
      isCorrectType: (keyValue) => {
        do stuff to check
        throw custom error to alert user if it doesn't pass the validation.
        do nothing if it does.
      }
    }

    This is well documented in the docs under validations and I saved a youtube
     video clearly documenting this.
  
  2)
  Friends Table
    their should be a uniqueness constraint on each pair
  3)
  Video Table
    Should be a uniqueness constraint on pair [channel_id, title]
  4)
  Messages Table
    either channel or friendid has to be null but one has to have a value as well
    need validation for this
